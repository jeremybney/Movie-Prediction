## Recommendations

This algorithm works based on the term frequency inverse document frequency (TFIDF) taken from IMDB descriptions of over 10,000 movies. Using director, movie keywords, cast, genres, titles, etc we are able to make educated recommendations for movies. This can work for many different datasets.
